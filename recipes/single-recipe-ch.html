            <p>chicken meat meal is the meat of the domestic goat (Capra hircus). The common name for goat meat is simply "goat", while that from young goats can be called "kid", capretto (Italian), or cabrito (Spanish and Portuguese). In South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, mutton commonly means goat meat.[1][2][3][4][5][6] In South Asia, where
                 mutton curry is popular, "mutton" is used for both goat and lamb meat.

                The culinary name "chevon", a blend of chèvre "goat" and mouton "sheep", 
                was coined in 1922 and selected by a trade association; it was adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1928.[7][8][9]: 19 , however the term never caught on and is not encountered in the United States. "Cabrito", a word of Spanish and Portuguese origin, refers specifically to the meat of a young, milk-fed goat. It is also known as chivo.</p>
            <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
            <p>Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a product of the rendering industry. It is typically about 48–52% protein, 33–35% ash, 8–12% fat, and 4–7% water. It is primarily used in the formulation of animal feed to improve the amino acid profile of the feed. Feeding of MBM to cattle is thought to have been responsible for the spread of BSE (mad cow disease); therefore, in most parts of the world, MBM is no longer allowed in feed for ruminant animals. However, it is still used to feed monogastric animals.[citation needed]

                MBM is widely used in the United States as a low-cost animal protein in dog food and cat food.[1] In Europe, some MBM is used as ingredients in pet food, but the majority is now used as a fossil-fuel replacement for energy generation, as a fuel in cement kilns, landfilling or incineration.[2]
